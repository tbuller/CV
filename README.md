## Tim Buller

I'm a 25 year old full-stack developer, and have professional experience in accounting, finance, real estate and hospitality.  My very first job felt like an introduction to the power of data, and I have worked my way up to successfully completing the Makers coding bootcamp. 

As an accountant at one of the big 4 I created data-heavy spreadsheets; in my hospitality, finance and real-estate roles I honed my numerical and people skills. Besides numbers, I have always been interested in languages (I am bilingual English-French, but also speak Spanish and workable Italian). Although I have now shifted my focus to more computer-based languages, I still cherish opportunities to practice and maintain my languages.

All aspects of tech excite me; I am avidly curious about how the world will be in the near future. Although a dedicated software developer, I have a strong interest in robotics and AI and keep up to date with developments in these areas. I feel that by staying close to related fields I will better understand the context of the work that I am doing.

## Skills

**Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.**

**Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.** 

#### Fast Learner
- Capable of learning and working on the fly. I had to balance exam study and full-time work at PwC, which taught me to be resourceful with my time.
- Learned new technologies such as React and MongoDB while working on projects. This taught me that I can thrive under pressure, and also that this was the best way to learn new technologies; applying them while doing research and learning.
- Used to being thrown in at the deep end: whether moving to a French school with zero French, or joining a Spanish company and working full-time in my third language

Here's an example

#### Communication
**I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.**

#### Mentoring
I provided mentoring for new joiners of PwC. I showed the new joiners how to carry out certain areas of the audit, what information to ask for from the client, and how to interpret client information. I also provided Excel/technical help. This helped me hone my mentoring and communication skills by learning how to effectively teach team members who didn't have as much knowledge of how the systems worked. Additionally, I provided Maths and French mentoring during my time at school.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (September 2022 to January 2023)
Selective full-stack software development bootcamp
- Learnt new programming languages and successfully implemented them in projects, combining them with various technologies such as the MERN stack
- Emphasis on OOP and TDD (jest, rsepc), instilling good programming practices
- Focus on group work i.e. pairing and working with AGILE principles. This has been beneficial to my ability to collaborate with others as well as my communication skills
- Heavy reliance on github for version control, as well as Trello and Miro for stand-ups
- Use of databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Other qualifications

**at in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person**
-CFAB accounting certification

## Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books (currently I'm reading an Italian book called Le tre del mattino), doing exercise such as running, and following sports such as basketball and rugby.
