## Tim Buller

I'm a 25 year old full-stack developer, and have professional experience in accounting, finance, real estate and hospitality. My very first job felt like an introduction to the power of data, and I have worked my way up to successfully completing the Makers coding bootcamp. I have developed a passion for software development with Makers which has given me extra confidence in my career-change. 

As an accountant at one of the big 4 I created data-heavy spreadsheets; in my hospitality, finance and real-estate roles I honed my numerical and people skills. Besides numbers, I have always been interested in languages (I am bilingual English-French, but also speak Spanish and workable Italian). Although I have now shifted my focus to more computer-based languages, I still cherish opportunities to practice and maintain my languages.

All aspects of tech excite me; I am avidly curious about how the world will be in the near future. Although a dedicated software developer, I have a strong interest in robotics and AI and keep up to date with developments in these areas. I feel that by staying close to related fields I will better understand the context of the work that I am doing.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner
I am capable of learning on the fly. This is evidenced by my time at PwC, during which I played key roles in teams that filed the accounts of large clients, all while I was studying for the ACA accounting exams. Furthermore, during my time at Makers I taught myself new technologies such as React, Express and MongoDB, while simultaneously working on projects that implemented these same technologies. This taught me that I can thrive under pressure and confirmed that this approach was the most suited to my learning style. Learning by doing is the best way to continually improve in my opinion.

#### An adaptable multi-tasker with good time management
Balancing exam study and full-time work taught me to be resourceful with my time and remain focused on more than one goal. I am used to being thrown in at the deep end: whether moving to a French school with zero French, or joining a Spanish company and working full-time in my third language, I am able to adapt and align myself to new environments, always hitting the ground running.

#### Collaborator and mentor
I provided training for new hires at PwC where I demonstarted how to conduct key audit procedures, how to solicit information from clients and how to correctly interpret data, and received excellent feedback for my mentoring. This showcases strong communication skills and an ability to break down abstract concepts in a digestible way. I also provided Excel/technical training to audit personnel. The act of teaching tested and improved my understanding, while sharpening my interpersonal skills and my ability to relate to others. Furthermore, I tutored Maths and French at school, a role I thoroughly enjoyed.

## Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books (currently I'm reading an Italian book called Le tre del mattino), doing exercise such as running, and following sports such as basketball and rugby. I also enjoy keeping up to date with the latest advancements/discoveries about space and tech (web-development, AI, robotics) via online forums.
